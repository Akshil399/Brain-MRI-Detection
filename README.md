# Brain Tumor Detection using MRI Images

## Problem Definition:
Identifying brain tumors accurately and efficiently from MRI scans is crucial for timely medical intervention. This project aims to develop a robust deep-learning model for automatic brain tumor detection.

## Project Overview:
Our project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques for detecting and classifying brain tumors from MRI images. By employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning, we aim to achieve high accuracy in categorizing tumors into four main types: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor.

## Model Architecture:
1. MRI Dataset: We utilize a comprehensive dataset of MRI images containing various brain tumor types.
2. Image Preprocessing: Before model training, we preprocess the MRI images to enhance their quality and standardize their format.
3. CNN - Transfer Learning: We employ a pre-trained CNN architecture, fine-tuned on our dataset to extract meaningful features from the MRI images.
4. Tumor Classification in Four Categories: The final model categorizes brain tumors into four distinct classes: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and No Tumor.
